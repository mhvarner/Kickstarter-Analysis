# Kickstarter-analysis
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns-
This Project was an analysis using a data table of over 4000 rows of different kickstarters around the world. Inside the file, you will see the data table, pivot tables of the information, statistical analysis of the kickstarters, VLOOKUPs of different kickstarters Louise (for whom we were doing the analysis for) wanted to benchmark, multitude of mean, median, mode, StDEV.P, QUARTILE.EXC, and box and whisker plot of the goals and pledges promised for the different kickstarters.
